/*
 * Binary search is an efficient algorithm for searching
 * a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval
 * in half. It works by comparing the target value to the
 * middle element of the array. If they are not equal,
 * the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated,
 * and the search continues on the remaining half until the
 * target is found or it's clear the target is not in the array.
