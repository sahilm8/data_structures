/*
 * The two-pointer technique is an algorithm design pattern
 * that uses two pointers to solve problems efficiently,
 * often reducing time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).
 * It's commonly used for problems involving arrays or linked lists,
 * especially when dealing with sorted data or when searching
 * for pairs with certain properties.
 * 
 * This two-pointer implementation demonstrates its use to find a pair
 * of numbers in an unsorted array that sum up to a target value:
